                <li>In rular areas, peasents and zamindars weere infuriated by the heavy taxes.</li>
                <li>Many peoples were unable to meet heavy revenue demand and repay their loans to money laenders, eventually losing the lands that they held for generations.</li>
                <li>Afer the Industrial Revolution in England, there was an influx of British manufactured goods into India, which ruined indusries Particularly textile industy of India.</li>
                <li>Indian handicraft industries had to compete with cheap machine-made goods from Britain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Military Causes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Revolt of 1857 began as a sepoy mutiny
                    <ul>
                        <li>Indian sepoy were considered inferior to the europeans.</li>
                        <li>Indian sepo was paid thatn a European sepoy of the same rank.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>In 1856 Lord Canning issued the General Services Enlistment Act which requires that the sepoy must be ready to serve in British land across the sea.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Intermediate Cause</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1857, the Revolt of 1857 broke out over the incident of greased cartidges.
                    <ul>
                        <li>There was a rumor that the cartidges of the new Enfield rifles were greased with cow and pig fat.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In Marcch 1857, Mangal Pandey, a sepot in barrackpore, had refuse to use the cartidges and attacked his senior officers
                    <ul>
                        <li>He was hanged to heath on 8th April</li>
                        <li>On 9th May 85 soilder in Merrut refosed to use the new rifles and were sentenced to ten years imprisonment.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Muslim Leauge - 1906</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>On 30 Decemebr 1906, the All-India Muslim was formed under the leadership of Aga Khan and Mohsin-ul-Mulk in Dhaka to safeguards the rights of Indian Muslims. Minto-II was the viceory of India during formation the leauge. </li>
                    <li>All- India muslim leauge was popularly known as Muslim Leauge.</li>
                    <li>India's first Muslim political party was the All-India Muslim League.</li>
                    <li>The idea was that the Congress party was only catering to the needs of the Hindus. This was an erroneous idea since Congress always meant to include every community fo the country and had many Muslim leaders as members.</li>
                    <li>First president of the leauge was Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah (Aga Khan III).</li>
                    <li>The Amritsar session of the Leauge, held in 1908, under the presidentship of Sir Syed Ali Imam, demanding a swperate electorate for the Muslims, this was admit to them by his Moreley Minto Reform 1909.</li>
                    <li>Maulana Muhammad Ali started an English Journal 'Comrade' and an Urdu Paper 'Hamdard' to propagate his anti-leuage views.</li>
                    <li>The objectives of the leauge were
                        <ul>
                            <li>To promote loyality of Inidans Muslims towards the British government.</li>
                            <li>To protecct the political and other rights of the Muslims and to place their needs and aspiraton before the Government.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In 1913, Muhammad Ali Jinnah joined the leauge. When the congress party was opposed to the government for the establishment of an independent India, the leauge propunded loyality to the government. They, infact provided the government with a tool to fight the growing nationalism in the country.</li>
                    <li>It came into the pictures after 1930, Leaders of the leauge began the propaganda that Hindus and Muslim are not one nation and have seperate sultures and identities although they have been cohabiting gor centuries.</li>
                    <li>In 1937, the Muslim Leauge was not able to form the government in any province election held that year as per the Government of India Act. Even in the 125 non-general constituencies out of which 59 were reserved for Muslims, the congress managed to win 25 seats with 15 seats coming from the Muslim dominated North-West Frontier Province.</li>
                    <li>In 1940, Jinah gave a speech in Lahore in which he talked of the impossibilities of living as one nation.
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this session Jinnah Demanded for Pakistan a seperate nation for Muslims.</li>
                            <li>In resopinse to this, some members of the leauge who were opposed to the Two-Nation Theory broke away from the party and formed the All-India Jamhur Muslim Leauge(AIJML). later AIJML merged with Congress.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The leauge was dissolved on 14 August 1947. It continues to exit in various forms as political parties n Pakistan, Bangladesh and India. In India, the India Union Muslim Leauge (in Kerala) align itself with the Congress party.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Cause of the War</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The new international expansionist policy of Germany: In 1890 the new emperor of Germany, wilhem II, began an international policy that sought to turn his country into a world power. Germany was seen as a threat by the other powers and destablized the international situation.</li>
                    <li>Mutual Defense Alliances : Countries throught Europe made mutual defence agreements. These treaties meant that if one country was attacked, allied countries were bound to defend them.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Triple Alliamce (1882) linking Germany with Austria-Hungary and Italy.</li>
                            <li>The Triple Entente, which was made up of Britain, France, and Russia, consluded by 1907</li>
                            <li>Thus Two rival groups formed in Europe.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Imperialism: Before WW I, Africa and parts of Asia were points of contention among the European countries because of their raw material The increasing competition and desire for geater empires led to an increase in the confrontation that helped push th eworld into WW I.</li>
                    <li>Milirarism: As the world entered the 20th century, an arms eace had begun. By 1914, Germany had the greatest increase i military buildup. Great Britain and Germany both great increased their navies in this time period. This increase in militarism helped push the countries involved into war.</li>
                    <li>Nationalism: Much of the origin of the war was based on the desire of the Slavic peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovinia to no longer be part of Austria Hungaru but insted to be part of Serbia. In this way, natioonalism led to the war.</li>
                    <li>Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: In June 194, Archduke Franz, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungaru, was shot while he was visitin Sarajevo in Bosnia. He was killed by a serbian person, who thought that serbia sould control Bosnial insted of Asutria. Because its leader had been shot, Austria-Hungaru declared on Serbia. As a result
                        <ul>
                            <li>Russia got incolved as it had an alliance with serbia.</li>
                            <li>Germany then decalred war on Russial because German had an alliance with Austria-Hungary.</li>
                            <li>Britain decalred war on Germany because of its invasion of neutral Belgium- Britain had agreements to protect both Belgium and France.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Some of the major battles during the war included the 
                        <ul>

                    <li>Taxation without representation - Since the colonies were not represented in the British parliament, many people asserted that the Brtish government had no rights to tax the colonies. They used slogan 'No Taxation without Representation.'</li>
                    <li>Protest - Through protest like Boston Tea Party (1773), where tea cartons carried by British ships were thrown at the sea, Britain's right to leavy taxes was eroded over time. This power was assumed by respective local governments.</li>

                    <li>Stamp Duty- In 1765, the British Parliament enacted the Stamp Act. It was made mandatory to affix stamps on every legal document. THis led to widespread protest, many of them turning violent.</li>
